<#
cbuild.ps1 â€” portable build wrapper for environments that have PowerShell.
Configured to always use MinGW-w64 GCC for this AoC project.

Usage:
  ./cbuild.ps1              # configure (if needed) + build with default flags
  ./cbuild.ps1 -Reconfigure # force CMake reconfigure

Notes:
- Assumes MinGW-w64 GCC is installed at C:/tools/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe
- Generates compile_commands.json for tooling.
- Run ./cclean.ps1 if you want a completely fresh build directory.
